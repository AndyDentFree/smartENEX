Start by reading content in the [wiki](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/smartENEX/wiki) which contains discussion of the project goals, technical background and team.

**NOTE** the Wiki updates, whilst under version control, do **not** show up as activity on the Pulse or any other stats, so if all that is happening is the Wiki being updated, the project appears dormant.

The revision history of wiki pages is linked just below each page's title.
